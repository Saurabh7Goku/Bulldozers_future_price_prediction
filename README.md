# Bulldozers_future_price_prediction
 ðŸšœ Predicting the Sale Price of Bulldozers using Machine Learning   In this notebook, we're going to go through an example machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers.  Since we're trying to predict a number, this kind of problem is known as a **regression problem**.  The data and evaluation metric we'll be using (root mean square log error or RMSLE) is from the [Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition]
 
 Notice: The Dataset is too big so visit this for the data... ----> (https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview).
